# Showcasing Node.js Memory Leaks

In order to expose the inspector, let's run Node.js with the `--inspect` flag.

```bash
node --inspect index.js

Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/7fc22153-836d-4ed2-8090-a84a842a199e
For help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector
Sample app listening on port 3000.
```

Open up Chrome and go to `chrome://inspect`. Here you can take snapshots of the memory usage.

```bash
open -a "Google Chrome" chrome://inspect/#devices
```

## **Watching Memory Allocation In Real-Time**

You use the `Allocation instrumentation on timeline` option in this case. Select that radio button and check the `Record stack traces of allocations` checkbox. This will start a live recording of the memory usage.

For this use case, I used `[loadtest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loadtest)` to run 1000 requests against the sample Express app with a concurrency of 10.

For the first few requests, you can see a spike in memory allocation. But itâ€™s obvious that most memory is allocated to the arrays, closure, and objects.
